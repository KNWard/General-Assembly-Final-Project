# General Assembly Final Project- Landing Page

## About This Project
Nova Butters landing page is the final project I completed for the General Assembly Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. Students were tasked to create a landing page of their choice utilizing skills learned during the bootcamp in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. W3 Schools was a huge resource for CSS styling options, especially 'cards' and different ways to style them.

### Built With
